# Excercises
Learning JavaScript

<b>Exercise 1: using the For statement:</b>

Using a for statement, sum the even integers from 2 to 12 inclusive to display the result, along with some accompanying text.
Use jQuery UI to allow the user to drag the HTML5 validator image to anywhere on the page.(sumDrag.html)

<b>Exercise 2: using While statement:</b>

Use a while statement to calculate the product and the sum of the odd integers from 1 to 11 inclusive, along with some accompanying text. Use jQuery UI to allow the user to drag the bunny to the surface of mars.(bunnyToMars.html)

<b>Exercise 3a: using Switch and For statement:</b>

Write a script using a switch statement to determine which physical tag is desired; namely either "Strong", "emphasize", or "underline". Use form input to obtain the physical type (1 for strong, 2 for emphasize, 3 for underlined) from the user and the desired number of lines (1-10).
Then use a for loop to display "Line" (either strong, emphasize, or underlined) for the desired number of lines.
If the user enters any character(s) except 1, 2, or 3 for the physical type or an invalid number of lines, then display "Invalid input".

<b>Exercise 3b: similar to exercise 3a</b>

Use jQuery to show/hide instructions and validate input data.

<b>Exercise 4: using multiple For statements.</b>

Write a script that displays a diamond shape of *s: You may use output statements that print a single asterisk (*), a single space or a single newline character. Maximize your use of repetition (with nested for statements), and minimize the number.
