<b>Exercise 2: using While statement:</b>

Use a while statement to calculate the product and the sum of the odd integers from 1 to 11 inclusive, along with some accompanying text. Use jQuery UI to allow the user to drag the bunny to the surface of mars.(bunnyToMars.html)

<b>Exercise 3a: using Switch and For statement:</b>

Write a script using a switch statement to determine which physical tag is desired; namely either "Strong", "emphasize", or "underline". Use form input to obtain the physical type (1 for strong, 2 for emphasize, 3 for underlined) from the user and the desired number of lines (1-10).
Then use a for loop to display "Line" (either strong, emphasize, or underlined) for the desired number of lines.
If the user enters any character(s) except 1, 2, or 3 for the physical type or an invalid number of lines, then display "Invalid input".
